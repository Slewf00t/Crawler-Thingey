# Crawler-Thingey
A basic webcrawler 

This repo is for documenting the progress of the frontend/backend or whatever this thing turns into.

I had an idea to build an interactive webcrawler that lets users control the flow of data in the style of a choose your own adenture novel.
The following is a rough draft of what I'd like this project to be. All of this is subject to change. 

# Methodology: 
  First approach: Imagine how the application should look and feel. Let form dictate function
  Second approach: Let the functionality of the application dictate how the user inteacts with the application. Let function dictate form.



# Rough draft:

 1. What does this do?
	1a. This project allows users to make, share, and save archaic and strange connections between content on the internet in a fun and interactive way. 
 
 2. Core project features:  Direct the user toward content 
 Allow the user to make connections between content 
 Allow the user to navigate from connection to connection
 Store connections and score them according to 'rarity'

 3. Fun ideas/potential features:
     Allow users to leave comments on conections or messages for other users (this should be restricted to some degree in order to prevent spam? Make this fun somehow)
     Include ways to augment or change how users  interact with connections. (Think class and multiclass system??? This would be fun if people could make their own)
    Allow users to host their own content? Like a myspace? Or should users be able to host their connections?
     Should there be an actual search function? What makes this more than just a biased web browser? Should the conections be random? Or should they be a continuous stream? (Imagine a quest? A narritive of content and connections?) 

	
	
	
	# Nuts and bolts:

	What needs to be in place for this to actually work:

1. Backend 
2. Frontend
3. Deployment - devops etc
